# Airbnb Pricing Analytics: A Data-Driven Approach for Investors

üìñ Project Overview

This project was created in August 2024 as part of the Python for Data Science course. The primary objective was to build a predictive model while exploring fundamental concepts in Python and leveraging the scikit-learn library.

My partner and I focused on Airbnb pricing analytics using a publicly available dataset from Kaggle, analyzing the data from the perspective of potential investors. Specifically, we aimed to identify the most profitable areas in Texas for hosting Airbnb properties, with an emphasis on our domain knowledge of the Dallas-Fort Worth (DFW) area.

üîç Key Project Steps

1.	Data Cleaning:
	‚Ä¢	Removed irrelevant records.
	‚Ä¢	Addressed missing values and inconsistencies in the dataset.
2.	Feature Engineering:
	‚Ä¢	Created new variables to enhance model performance.
	‚Ä¢	Filtered the dataset to focus exclusively on cities within Texas.
3.	Visualization:
	‚Ä¢	Used Python libraries like matplotlib and seaborn to explore trends and showcase key insights.
4.	Predictive Modeling:
	‚Ä¢	Leveraged scikit-learn to develop a pricing model that highlights factors influencing Airbnb prices.

üåü Highlights and Learnings

‚Ä¢	Gained hands-on experience in Python for data analysis, visualization, and machine learning.
‚Ä¢	Developed an investor-focused approach to Airbnb property analytics.
‚Ä¢	Improved skills in working with real-world data through exploration, cleaning, and visualization.

üöÄ Future Directions

While this project focused on historical data, future enhancements could include:
	‚Ä¢	Incorporating live or streaming data to make dynamic, real-time predictions.
	‚Ä¢	Building an interactive application where users can input a ZIP code and get insights into its profitability based on:
	‚Ä¢	Average rental prices.
	‚Ä¢	Current home costs in the area.
	‚Ä¢	Investment potential based on historical trends.
